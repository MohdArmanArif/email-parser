As this is a smaller resonator it will not be as much as some of our other bigger resonators like the ultra quiet. I would suggest having a look on youtube for sound clips where people show what the bottle style sounds like. This will be the best indication you will have of whether this will work for what you want. Hope that information helps and please feel free to reach back with any further questions.

I live in BC, where the limit is 83 dBA (from the Motor Vehicle Act), so am looking at adding an additional resonator to the system to drop a bit more volume.Speaking with a local exhaust shop, I was told that a resonator typically drops overall exhaust volume by 10-15dBA, depending on resonator size. For your part number 1790, would you say it's a safe bet that that resonator would drop about 10 dBA, given that it's a smaller resonator? I very much enjoy the sound of my car, so want to be able to hear it, but I can't risk being illegal, as the car is my daily.Thanks,Colin"

The reason for that is that there are many variables that go into the sound of a car and how much the resonator can reduce it (NA vs turbo, engine config, etc). We are at the beginnings to producing a sound library to help with questions like this but that will take a while to be finished. I would say that you can find many online resources (forum, youtube) showing the bottle style and even comparing it to straight piped. There will be people with a similar setup to you as well and that will give you the most information. It will also give you an idea of the tone to expect from our products.

In terms of drone there are a few pieces of advice we offer our customers. Definitely we would suggest a good quality resonator (I’m not familiar with the magapack but if you like it then all good). We usually suggest customers to place a resonator (as you have) in the same location it was on the stock exhaust. This is because OEMs have tools to analyze where the drone will arise from and they place their stock resonator accordingly. It would be best and easiest to follow that location. If you’ve already done so, the next step could be to notice what location the drone is arising from while driving (a friend in the car could help). Based off of that, placing another resonator in that location should help reduce the drone.

The problem is it is nearly impossible to get this thing out. I slipped the first silencer in for 5 minutes coming home to not wake up neighbors and I ended up needing a slide hammer to remove it. Pulled on it for a few hours, tried getting it hot, lubricated it, nothing worked until the slide hammer. So since that one got a bit mangled I ordered another one.With the second one to try to make it easier to remove, I filed down the outer lip of the silencer that would be touching the exhaust tip before trying to put it in. Went to put it in and this one and this one feels extremely tight before even getting to the point that I filed down.Is this normal or is there some kind of trick I don't know? At this point i don't even want to try putting the second one in because I can already tell it's going to get stuck.Any help would be appreciated.Thanks,Mike"

First of all, can I just know where you purchased this from and do you have a receipt by any chance? The silencer is designed to have a tight clearance will the muffler tip. This is so that there is a tight seal around the outside and the gasses do not escape. However, this shouldn’t be difficult to the point where the silencer gets damaged while removing it. Since any soot or debris buildup can make the tight tolerances even tighter, I would suggest performing a throrough clean of the tip before you install it. If you’re still having issues please send us some detailed photos of the silencer, the tip, any measurements you may be able to take with a caliper along with letting us know where you purchased from.

It has failed at the 90 bend swivel area, where there is a small hole. I'm assuming that hole is for assembly purposes. The fitting holds whenever I pressurize the coolant system, but as soon as I move the line a little (vibration), it spits coolant out of the hole.I have attached pictures below of what I am referring to. I am guessing the failure happened due to high heat from the turbo and whatever seals that swivel (guessing an o ring of some kind) just can not take the heat. (You can see in the pictures the black anodization has turned brown/gold)The reason I am reaching out is to see what is recommended to use in this area. I was trying to find a non-Swivel fitting, but from my research Vibrant does not make a non-PTFE non-swivel fitting. Maybe just replacing the fitting and adising my client that we use a turbo blanket?You can reach me at this email, or I am available by phone at (919)-817-1454, Mon-Fri from 10AM to 6PM EST.Thanks in advance for any help than can be provided,Archangel Fabrication LLC.Cristian Garcia | Owner919.817.1454 | Archangelfabllc@gmail.com"

        "Role": "Assistant",
        "Content": "Hi Luis, Thanks for reaching out and for your interest in Vibrant products. Unfortunately, your question of “how quiet” is a bit difficult to answer. All of our mufflers/resonators are universal and there are many factors that contribute to the loudness (like V6 vs V8, NA vs turbo etc). I would say that the best way for you to get a sense of how this resonator will perform is to have a browse on youtube and find some examples of people using it in a similar application as you (I’ve attached some sample links)https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jWMCqibOMR8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDgeXw1GdnsCustomers do generally say that our products have a deep tone, again this you can hear through the videos and see how you like it. I’ve also attached our FAQ below.I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it?Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   •              Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify. •              Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring. •              Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system. Hope that information helps and please feel free to reach back with any further questions.

Typically, for street cars, a lot of people like to run the smaller to medium size catch cans.  If you are motor racing, you will have to look into what the size requirements are for that racing series. Some racing bodies requires you to have the same volume as the engine displacement.

I have removed the front factory cats but has secondary cats when its dual exhaust before it becomes single 3inch. I have very bad drone in the 2k-3k range so i added an additional 2 additional 1790 resonators and it didnt help much.I then after the downpipe made a merge to a single 3inch exhaust, added the 1142 resonator, 3inch 200 cell high flow cat 3inch, 3inch flex pipe, to the same muffler. The drone has reduced significantly but is still minor. Mind you the original muffler has a flap used with a vacuum line.

I would like to able to incorporate the sound in the video but with a muffler. If there a different muffler i can use you recommend that wont be too loud? I think the current one muffles a little too much? Its common practice on this engine on the 3 series e90 to delete the mufflers and to add the 1142 resonators on each side since its dual all the day and there is zero drone and noise is tolerable. cell phone 818 800 9278"

I'll be using this at a dry sump pump scavenge exit to isolate the flow back of oil to the oil pan.  It will be subject to repeated high pressure cycles so I want to make sure the part I use is robust and suitable for its application.  The cracking pressure needs to be somewhat low to reduce restriction when pressures are lower.  It will be an oil/air incompressible mixture so pressures could be lower.  I know the piston is a pretty durable design but I'm interested in how high the cracking pressure might be.  Furthermore I know that generally the flapper style has a lower cracking open pressure but I've seen some pretty flimsy designs out there so I'd like to ensure it at least incorporates a metallic torsion spring and metal hinge so that it can withstand repeated pressure cycles and maintain good reliability.  Please advise which part might work best based on the application/description.  Thanks."

        "Content": "Hi Mike, Thanks for reaching out and for your interest in Vibrant products. Unfortunately, because exhaust tones and loudness depend on many variables, I can’t give you an exact idea of what the exhaust might sound like in your application. However, to give you an idea of our products, they are all straight through perforated core designs which allow for exhaust breathability while minimizing back pressure. The differences between our products comes down to the internal volume, the more internal volume the quieter it will be. Unfortunately, this process is usually a trial and error situation, but I would suggest looking into people with a similar application who are running our products (youtube or forums). I will attach an additional FAQ down below for your further information. I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it?Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   •              Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify. •              Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring. •              Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system. All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust. They are not flow directional.Inlet/outlets are sized by the inside diameter. This means the exhaust tubing will slip inside the resonator/muffler neck and a lap joint weld will be made on each end to install it. Hope that information helps and please feel free to reach back with any further questions.

In terms of the placement, we always advise customers to follow the OEM placement of the mufflers and resonators. In the magna flow system you’re showing the two quarter wave resonators are probably where there were some mufflers for stock. Regardless, with this system I wouldn’t think the placement is too critical so perhaps somewhere upstream of the quarter waves.

Does it matter which line goes to which port?*   No, it doesn’t matter. You can use any port for the “dirty” lines (up to three) and one port for the vacuum or vent to atmosphere line. Each of the four ports on our Gen 3 catch cans is equipped with its own filter barrel assembly, so the order doesn’t affect functionality.2.  Can I run one line from each valve cover and cap the other two ports?*   Yes. If you’d like to combine both valve cover lines into a single port using a “Y” adapter, that’s also an option. Alternatively, you can route each valve cover line into its own port, block off any unused ports, and use the remaining port for a vacuum source.*   It’s crucial to keep the catch can under vacuum and avoid pressurizing it, especially in a high-boost application. Regarding check valves: in high-heat or extended two-step scenarios, some check valves can degrade. If your exhaust system experiences backpressure or isn’t flowing enough to create vacuum, the flow can reverse and push exhaust gases back into the crankcase. If you decide to use our piston style check valves, keep in mind that there is an O-Ring inside and our check valve is rated for 205°C.  Our catch cans are universal, so how you route your lines (and whether you incorporate a check valve) is up to you. Just be aware of the potential heat-related wear on valves if you choose to use them. Also note that the port at the bottom of the catch can is a drain port.  Hope this information helps.

        "Content": "Hi Shawn, Sorry for the delay, your last emails had ended up in my spam folder. To answer your question, we can’t really provide a recommendation on this topic as there are a lot of variables at play. The choice depends on your engine configuration, available space, and how consistently you need vacuum throughout the RPM range. Both systems have pros and cons, and it all depends on what you want to do. For instance: For Exhaust evac:At wide-open throttle or high RPM, common in racing, the exhaust flow is significant, generating a steady negative pressure that effectively evacuates blow-by gases. It is very important to ensure the exhaust system isn’t creating excessive backpressure. In worst-case scenarios, this could reverse flow and push exhaust gases back into the crankcase. For intake (pre-turbo) applications:This can also provide vacuum, but in a turbocharged application, boost pressure may reduce vacuum at higher RPM. Also, any blow-by or oil vapor drawn through the intake could coat the compressor wheel, ultimately putting any unfiltered oil vapors back into your system. Part# 11120 has an O-ring on the female ORB side, so it is also rated to 205°C. This is our old ball style check valve which uses a ball and spring mechanism.  Our piston style check uses tapered face and O-ring to make the seal. This can hold back up to 300PSI of backpressure with no leaks.  Hope this information helps. Thanks,Tasin    "

I see you make a 12766 or similar. It has 4 ports.  Can I just have two incoming hoses(one from each valve cover) and then a single outlet back to the intake tube in between the supercharger and the throttle body?  I would cap the fourth hole with an AN cap.  I only have one location where I can route the vapors back into the engine. The engineering side of me is fully aware that by necking down to a single -10 on the outlet that I will double the velocity of gasses leaving the catch can.  There would be a miniscule pressure increase.  That said, it should have already been filtered inside the can where the gas velocity drops so no problem is what I say.  Your thoughts on that? The engine breathes enough that I can see a whisper of smoke coming from under the hood at stoplights and I would rather just reingest that smoke and whatnot into the engine.  The open can was a little too racecar for my preference.  Also, my 12695 will spit a little into the engine bay so everything gets all oily.  I'm looking to get around that.  This is my YT channel and I made a video of my current setup.  What am I doing wrong?  You can clearly see that the hoses go uphill to the can which I thought would help some with the spitting.  Mishimoto makes a 3 port and maybe thats the best way for my application. https://www.mishimoto.com/xl-baffled-oil-catch-can-3-port.html?sku=MMBCC-CBTHR-XLBK&mtm_campaign=21573812114&mtm_kwd=&mtm_source=google&mtm_medium=cpc&mtm_content=708682457011&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAh6y9BhBREiwApBLHC0-CD0_M_i85k98trd6tFEYpcX51FWQh7j2vRUP_O5Xk05F300i5jxoCgn4QAvD_BwEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riMlcLew0SQThanks,Neil Kaltsulas605BOLT YouTube Channel"

Can I just ask which resonator you have installed? The most important factor when tackling drone is the placement of your resonator. We always recommend our customers to place the resonator exactly where the resonator was located on the stock exhaust or as close as possible. This gives the best chance to attack the drone from where it resonates. For our muffler and resonator products, the larger the body/internal volume, the more packing material it has and the quieter the sound will be. Therefore, the second suggestion would be to size your resonator slightly larger.

The Gen 3 Catch Cans features -12 ORB (O-Ring Boss) ports, meaning, you can use a -12 ORB to AN adapter to connect your lines. In your case, if the mechanic is running -10 lines, they might be using a -12 ORB to -10 AN adapter to match those lines. These are standard adapter fittings, and you can swap them out for different sizes as long as one end remains a -12 ORB male fitting. If you’re running -10 AN lines, simply replace the -12 ORB to -12 AN adapter with a -12 ORB to -10 AN adapter (Part #16837). That way, you can keep your existing lines without issue.

Unfortunately, since all of our products are universal, we do not have any vehicle specific information. But I can give you a few specific pieces of advice for your system: 1.  We always suggest to replace like for like. This means if your OEM setup comes with one resonator and one muffler, we recommend having the same on your custom exhaust. It will still be more free flowing and louder than OEM as we only sell straight through designs, but this setup will also help avoid drone. Critically, we would also suggest placing the muffler/resonator in the same location as OEM. The location is very important and is determined by the OEM. Here is the link to our catalogue for your review: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/78ip8w6d0nuxwayoyjnx6/2022-Vibrant-Performance-Catalogue-Web-Version.pdf?rlkey=6dxuf7ee3iai6yniudikvnnwu&e=2&utm_campaign=Download+Digital+25th&utm_medium=Social+Media&utm_source=Linkin.Bio&dl=0 I will also attach our muffler FAQ below: I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it?Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   •              Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify. •              Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring. •              Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system. All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust. They are not flow directional. Hope that information helps and please feel free to reach back with any further questions.

When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   •              Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify. •              Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring. •              Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system. All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust. They are not flow directional.

The tool required is 7/16 in, the diameter is smaller C. Would both nuts be torqued to 36-48 in.lbs? Both nuts are to be tightened against each other to the torque spec D. Would recommend changing the lock nut (flex-top locknut) provide with the kit after a number of untightening tightening? In critical applications you can consider it one time use. Otherwise, you can use it a handful of times or until you feel that the nut does not bite/provide resistance. Unfortunately, we don’t have a similar installation guide but I hope that helps.

        "Content": "Hi Ricky Thank you for reaching out and your interest in Vibrant Performance Products! Based on the initial part number you gave me for the TPV muffler (Part# 1057) which has an inlet size of 2.50”, I’ve compiled a list of mufflers with 2.50” inlet options.  Again, to recap, all Vibrant mufflers will be louder than typical OEM systems because of their straight-through design and perforated core. However, it’s hard to predict exactly how much louder they will be, as that depends on several factors such as engine configuration (V8, V6, I4, etc.), forced induction (turbocharged or naturally aspirated), engine displacement, exhaust diameter, and so on. If needed, you can always reduce the exhaust note later by adding resonators or additional mufflers wherever space allows. Below are my recommendations for rear mufflers, along with attached PDFs containing detailed specifications. The overall volume is similar within each muffler family, and I’ve noted their packing volumes for reference:1.  Flat Black Universal Mufflers*   Part #12315, #12325, or #12335 (all 2.50\" inlets)*   Packing volume: 657 cubic inches*   These are the quietest options among the recommended mufflers, with different tip styles available. See the “Flat Black Universal Mufflers” PDF for dimensions.2.  StreetPower Universal Mufflers (Single Tip)*   Part #1046 or #1034 (both 2.50\" inlets)*   Packing volume: 474 cubic inches*   See the “StreetPower Universal Mufflers” PDF for details.3.  StreetPower Universal Mufflers (Dual Tip)*   Part #1094 or #1040 (both 2.50\" inlets)*   Packing volume: 452 cubic inches*   Also referenced in the “StreetPower Universal Mufflers” PDF.4.  TPV Muffler*   Part #1057 (2.50\" inlet)*   Packing volume: 351 cubic inches If you’re looking for the quietest option, I would recommend one of the Flat Black Universal Mufflers (12315, 12325, or 12335).

The most important factor when it comes to reducing drone is the placement of the resonator. The tip we give to most customers is to mimic the placement of the stock resonator as that is what the OEM determined to be the most likely location for drone to originate. If the you’ve already tried the above method then a second resonator could be a good idea. To find the appropriate placement for this one, you should try to locate where the drone in the car is coming from (under driver’s seat, under passenger’s seat, etc) and place the resonator in that location.

        "Content": "Hi David, Thanks for reaching out and for your interest in Vibrant products. All of our mufflers have a similar sound signature with a deeper tone, given the straight through perforated exhaust. As for the volume and drone please see the sizing and placement portion of our FAQ below. And for your last question it depends on two main things, how much space do you have under the car and what is your noise goal. Bottle style into ultra quiet will be loudest, then the 2 ultra quiets and the ultra quiet into streetpower will be quietest. I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it?Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   •              Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify. •              Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring. •              Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system. All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust. They are not flow directional.

Unfortunately, as there are many variables that go into the specific sound output of a specific system it is very difficult for us to provide a frequency range.

As for the differences between the ultra-quiet and bottle-style, the ultra-quiet in general has more packing material and due to its oval shape it can attack a wider range of frequencies.

I was hoping you could provide more detail on the frequency ranges—for example. the Ultra-Quiet resonator helps block 50Hz-1kHz, while the Bottle resonator targets 1kHz-3kHz.I realize I’m likely part of a small group with a heightened sensitivity to certain frequencies, so it’s not really about achieving a specific sound. I’ve watched countless YouTube videos and read through numerous exhaust forums where people focus on reducing drone or rasp after modifications like cat-back exhausts and downpipes. However, my goal is simply to “transform” the sound of my stock exhaust.I’m about to work with a local shop to replace the stock resonator with one of yours. It’ll probably be a trial-and-error process to find out which one works best. That said, would there be any benefit or harm in running both resonators at once, in case one doesn't work well by itself? I’ve seen setups where people use the Ultra-Quiet as a muffler, but I’d like to keep my stock muffler and just use two resonators.Thanks again,ChrisOn Monday, February 24, 2025 at 03:42:11 PM EST, Arman Arif  wrote: Hi Chris, Thanks for reaching out and for your interest in Vibrant products.

As for running two resonators in line, there should be no issues with this whatsoever.

        "Role": "Assistant",
        "Content": "Hi Kevin,There are actually two different 3\" bottle style resonators with a 14\" body length. One has a 5\" body OD (PN17950) and the other has a 4\" body OD (PN1795).In terms of the sound, the Ultra Quiet (PN1142) will have similar sound suppression as the PN17950, and the PN1795 will have less sound suppression. However, since the ultra quiet has an oval shape it can help target a wider range of frequencies than the other two.Please see our muffler/resonator FAQ down below:I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it?Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.  There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.  •\tSize.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify.•\tPlacement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring.•\tSpacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system.All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust. They are not flow directional.Inlet/outlets are sized by the inside diameter. This means the exhaust tubing will slip inside the resonator/muffler neck and a lap joint weld will be made on each end to install it.Hope that information helps and please feel free to reach back with any further questions.Thanks,Arman Arif-----Original Message-----"

Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name \"Resonator\" is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name \"Muffler\" is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.  > > There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.  > > *\tSize.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify.> > *\tPlacement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body \"bottle style\" resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring.> > *\tSpacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5') without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system.> > All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust.

        "Content": "Hello,I read online that we can ask technical questions to Vibrant at this email to help guide our purchase.I have an exhaust resonance that occurs at exactly around 2000 RPM on my 3.0L V6 engine with its current 2.5 inch exhaust setup. Based on the engines firing order, this 2000 RPM resonance translates to a 100Hz frequency that needs to be canceled or toned down. I should also note that outside the 2000 RPM range, there is no resonance or 'rasp'. Based on this information, can you recommend which Vibrant product would bsest be suited to target the problem frequency I'm seeing? I would like to keep the current volume of the exhaust close to the same, but I understand if that isn't exactly possible. Thank you!Vedo"

        "Content": "Hi Vedo, Thanks for reaching out and for your interest in Vibrant products. We provide two main series of resonators which can help you eliminate the issue you’re facing, the ultra-quiet and bottle style series. Unfortunately we do not have exact ranges of frequencies that these resonators can target, as there are also many more variables that go into that. The main difference between the ultra-quiet and the bottle style is the shape of the muffler. With the ultra-quiet being an oval shape, it technically has a variety of diameters in one resonator. This variety in diameter allows it to attack a range of frequencies more effectively. So this might be better at tackling drone. Another difference is that the ultra-quiets generally have more internal volume compared to the bottle styles. More volume in the muffler results in more packing inside, which allows for more sound deadening and a quieter exhaust (slightly). Please also see our muffler/resonator FAQ below.I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it?Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   •         Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify. •         Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring. •         Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system. All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust. They are not flow directional.Inlet/outlets are sized by the inside diameter. This means the exhaust tubing will slip inside the resonator/muffler neck and a lap joint weld will be made on each end to install it. Hope that information helps and please feel free to reach back with any further questions.

Cutting the hose and installing the hose end was straightforward. However, when I attempted to install the flare end (I do use assembly oil/lube too), it was very difficult. It would only tighten by hand for a couple turns. The remainder required excessive force. Is there any tricks or tips with your fittings using the black/red hose? One of the issues I ran into was that the hose started spinning as I was tigthtening the flare end (however the hose was not backing out of the hose end). Once I got past this, the force on the wrench was 2x-5x times more than other hoses I assembled in the past. I did unscrew it out and then back it out to ensure the aluminum threads on the hose end weren't stripping and that the hose itself wasn't somehow damaged. Of course, screwing the flare end back on was easier the 2nd time. I did 3 hoses and all were the same level of difficulty. In addition, do you recommend a small gap between the hose end and flare end fitting or butting up to each other? Appreciate your advice as I have several more hoses to assemble and concerned something is not right.Regards,Wayne"

        "Content": "Hi Stephen, Thank you for reaching out and your interest in Vibrant Performance products. A big aspect in eliminating drone is determining the location it’s coming from. Usually swapping a resonator into the spot of the stock one is a good start but it seems you’ve already done that. Resonators work best at eliminating drone when they are placed at the approximate spot that the drone can be heard from. For this, you can try the car at drone RPM’s and try to hear how far back the drone is coming from (a friend in the car can help). All of our products are universal so I can’t tell which resonators will work for your vehicle. I am attaching the link to our catalogue that gives all the information on each of our resonators (page 126) https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/78ip8w6d0nuxwayoyjnx6/2022-Vibrant-Performance-Catalogue-Web-Version.pdf?rlkey=6dxuf7ee3iai6yniudikvnnwu&e=2&utm_campaign=Download+Digital+25th&utm_medium=Social+Media&utm_source=Linkin.Bio&dl=0. Please also see our muffler/resonator FAQ below. Hope that information helps and please feel free to reach back with any further questions.I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it?Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   •         Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify. •         Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring. •         Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system. All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust.   They are not flow directional.Inlet/outlets are sized by the inside diameter.  This means the exhaust tubing will slip inside the resonator/muffler neck and a lap joint weld will be made on each end to install it. Hope that information helps and please feel free to reach back with any further questions.

        "Content": "Hello Arman!Thanks for the quick response and helpful advice!I think you got it right with the FAQ:in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring.I installed the first UQ resonator right under the driver’s seat towards the beginning of the catback exhaust and it replaced the stock bottle neck shaped resonator (aftermarket exhaust) which was much smaller. This 1 UQ resonator 100% decreased a lot of unwanted drone and made me smile. So it definitely works in the front and driver and passenger seat!My kids in the back of the hatchback complain of drone in the rear (at lower RPMs) so the FAQ matches up with that perfectly. It may be that hatchbacks allow more drone to enter because it’s open area compare to a sedan trunk.Do you think if I add a second UQ resonator towards the back where they’re hearing drone it may help? Have others reported success of having 2 UQ resonators in your experience?Just asking because you said it may have diminishing returns. And I trust your advice as you’ve seen a lot of experiences!The UQ resonator helped hugely lower the drone in the front and passenger seats, and I’m curious if adding a second UQ resonator towards the back under the rear seats if that may help tone down a little more drone (even if a little that would be good for the rear passengers haha).Thanks again and let me know your thoughts!Thanks,Ryan  Sent from my iPhoneOn Jan 14, 2025, at 9:41 AM, Arman Arif  wrote:in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area.

Coincidentally, both of these resonators have almost the exact same volume. Another thing to keep in mind is that the ultra quiet can attack a larger range of frequencies due to its oval shape. Because of that if you have the space, I would recommend going with that. Otherwise, the bottle style should do a pretty decent job nonetheless. Hope that helps. Thanks,Arman Arif "

        "Content": "Hi Livi, The main variable in finding the length of your J-pipe is definitely the wavelength of the sound you are trying to suppress. First of all, I’d definitely suggest taking the time to use sound equipment to measure which frequencies have the peak amplitude in your system. I recommend that over trying to come up with theoretical calculations for it as that can be inaccurate. Once you know the frequency (and from that the wavelength), the J-pipe is simply as the name suggests, a quarter wavelength. This is because as the sound travels down the pipe and back (half wavelength round trip), it’s phase shifted exactly 180° (half wavelength) from the original wave and can destructively interfere with it. For example, if I noticed on my sound analyzer that I have a peak at 500Hz, the wavelength would depend on the speed of sound. To find that I would need to know my average exhaust temperature by measuring it (ex 750 °C), and the speed of sound would be 641 m/s. The wavelength then is 1.28 m and my J-pipe would need to be 0.32 m. As you can see it will become longer and longer as you try to attack lower frequencies. I hope that helps and let me know if there is anything I could clarify. Good luck on your build.

However, as I mentioned, J-pipes would have to get longer to attack lower frequencies. An alternative would be the Helmholtz resonator (which is similar to a J-pipe but not identical). When using a Helmholtz resonator, the critical variable is the volume of the closed can instead of just the length. The math is a bit complex, but I found a good resource that I think would help you:  https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/Helmholtz.html Hope that helps you get started in the right direction.

        "Content": "Hi Austin, Thanks for reaching out and for your interest in Vibrant products. This is definitely a very interesting idea that you have for your setup. I will try to answer your questions below and give some of my own thoughts: 1.  Will the H-Pipe before the resonators cause any issue with their performance?I haven’t heard of many applications where users have both an X-pipe and an H-pipe. This is because in essence they are trying to accomplish the same thing. I don’t see a specific reason why the H-pipe before would be an issue, but typically they are after the resonators. An X-pipe usually gives more of a smoothed out sound vs the more clapping/distinct sound of the H-pipe (personally if I had to pick one, it would be the X-pipe) 2.  Will the double-resonator setup be redundant/pointless?Double resonators would not necessarily be pointless, but it will muffle your exhaust more and give a deeper sound. It all depends on what your loudness goal is here. There are definitely some diminishing returns with the more muffler you add though. I would also try to place one set of resonators at approximately the location of the stock one, as this is the point where drone is most likely to originate from. 3.  Does the length of the resonator determine which frequency is nullified/reduced, or is that determined by the internal baffling?No, the frequency range that is eliminated depends more on the OD of the resonator. Because of this, we normally recommend our ultra-quiet (it’s an oval so it has many ODs) over the bottle style when trying to attack different drone frequencies. With an increase in length there will be an increase of internal volume and packing material, and therefore a decrease in volume. 4.  Is it possible to know if this will stifle the drone without installing it, or will this be a “buy it and try it” situation?Unfortunately, since there are many variable and many complicated principles at play exhaust work is always an experimental process. There are definitely best practises that should be followed, some of which I’ve mentioned above, but it’s very difficult to guarantee. On top of that, exhaust sound is a subjective thing so what sounds good to someone might not be the ideal for you.

If you want to transition from 2.5” aluminum tubing to 3” HD clamp, then you will need our 2.5” tube to 3” HD aluminum weld ferrule (part# 12661). Next, you will need our 3” stainless steel weld ferrule (Sold in Pairs, part# 12556).If you do not have a 3” union sleeve (part# 12566), you will need one as well to go with the 3” HD Clamp (part# 32536). Keep in mind that these are all individual components and are sold separately. If this is your first time using our HD Clamps, I also recommend using the HD Clamp alignment tool during fabrication. This tool is designed to keep both weld ferrules concentric with each other to avoid leaks post fabrication. Since you are using 3” HD clamps, you will want to use the 3” HD alignment tool (part# 12626 ).  Our HD clamps are designed to provide a flexible (floating) connection while have a rigid solid structure. For the best outcome, we recommend using 2 HD clamps per tubing e.g., connecting from turbo to intercooler – use 2 clamps, one on the turbo side and one on the inlet side of the intercooler.

All of our products are universal, meaning they can have different setups from vehicle to vehicle even in the same model.  Can you confirm if you have a gen3 catch can or gen2. The newer gen3 cans will have a knurl on the body and are threaded at the top and bottom. So you can unscrew the body without removing the backet. It can be a little challenging to unthread, especially if it’s the first time and if the O-ring is dry and not lubricated.  If you cannot twist it off by hand, you can try to use a rubber strap, or leather belt on the knurled portion of the Can. If you end up needing to put it in a vise to do this, we recommend using a thick cloth or towel around the Can to prevent it from getting scratched. The gen2 catch cans will have welds on it. You had mentioned that the catch can came with a drain pipe that is connected underneath. Is it difficult to get to the drain valve? If this is the case, you might have to redo the drain line and place the valve somwhere more easily accessible. Hope this information helps.

I can go direct from cat to resonator or anywhere within a 45\" long path before I run into a moderate sized straight through wool packed mid muffler.  I will have about 30\" of pipe after the mid muffler to tip of tail pipe exit.   I have read that directly under the drivers seat is a good place to put it.  My goal is to cancel out as much drone as possible and to end up with a noticeable exhaust note / volume yet retain a smooth mature tone.   It is a full ss 3\" system on a 17' vw Passat 1.8t made by ECS Tuning and only has the one mid muffler in their system which I fear may be too aggressive for my liking.  I currently have to resonators tuned to 50hz and 125hz and I have zero drone but want to upgrade to a more professional looking setup and 3\" v 2.5\" piping.  -Best location in my situation to install ultra quiet resonator?-What average temp can the resonator packing withstand if I mount it closer to turbo? -should I need to, I can also fit (v the ultra flow) # 17950 bottle style resonator instead.  I see they have about the same volume and packing material but not sure which shape would do better at limiting the lower hz say 40-60hz offending tone if either shape.

If you want to quiet down your vehicle close to OEM level, then we would recommend placing the biggest size mufflers and resonators you can fit. This will give you the best results.  Please review our resonator/muffler FAQ response for additional insight that will help with your decision:I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it?Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   •         Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify. •         Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring. •         Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system. All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust.   They are not flow directional.Inlet/outlets are sized by the inside diameter.  This means the exhaust tubing will slip inside the resonator/muffler neck and a lap joint weld will be made on each end to install it. Hope this information helps.

For the Vibrant Horizontal Core 24in x 9.75in x 3.5in, the max theoretical HP is about 700.  There are several factors in play here. Sizing an appropriate intercooler is an exercise in balancing thermal efficiency, flow capacity, and fitment for a particular horsepower target and boost level.  300 whp, in theory, require a flow capacity of about 275-350 CFM of air approximately. These numbers are very rough and not scientific or exact. Too small of an intercooler will result in excessive pressure drop, decreasing efficiency and even robbing hp; larger cores typically have less pressure drop but might compromise thermal efficiency if airflow through the core is not enough. It is up to you to perform the initial research regarding the setup you are trying to achieve.  We have a core that is 17.75in x 9.75in x 3.5in (Part# 12833) and is rated for 450hp.Another core: 20.00in x 11.00in x 3.5in (part# 12835) and is rated for 500hp. Either of these cores is ideal for your application, it is up to you which one you want to go with. Both can hold pressure above 15-18psi. Hope this information helps.

At the end of the setup, there are three mufflers (one on each side and one in the center, see pic below).  After having the Beluga exhaust installed, I found the sound to be far too quiet. So, I had the Beluga resonator removed and replaced with a 12-inch bottle-style resonator from Vibrant.  Now it sounds much better and louder than with the Beluga resonator, but I still find it a bit too raspy. I’m now considering replacing the 12-inch Vibrant resonator with an 18-inch Vibrant resonator.  My question is: will that help enough to achieve a deeper, less raspy tone?  Is the difference between the 12-inch and 18-inch resonators significant enough?Looking forward to your reply.Have a great week.Kind regards,Mark SpanjersbergPic below of the Beluga Racing set up:  "

Size:Using the Vibrant Performance Selection chart, all mufflers and resonators are grouped by Inlet/outlets, then listed in increasing sound absorption effectiveness. Inlets/outlets are sized by the inside diameter, this means the exhaust tubing will slip inside the resonator/muffler neck and a lap joint weld will be made on each end to install it. All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust. They are not flow directional. The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Our selection chart organizes our wide range of products from least to most sound suppressive.  Resonators are typically the most compact, loudest and least sound suppressive.  They are geared towards attenuating drone frequencies in tight spaces. Larger body mufflers, with more internal volume of sound absorption material, allows them to attenuate a broad range of frequencies.Mufflers can be used in place of a resonators when drone and sound levels are excessive.  Resonators typically utilize smaller bodies and are used in the front to mid-pipe area of the exhaust to control droning frequencies. Mufflers are typically larger body, in order to be effective across a wide range of the RPM band, available with/without tips towards the back of your exhaust system.Our range of bottle style resonators have always been a popular choice, but in instances where space is limited or drone is excessive, the use of our Ultra Quiet oval body resonators offers an effective, compact acoustic solution.Placement:For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle. Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving). Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from resonating the full length of your exhaust. Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.Spacing:When you have a long length of exhaust tubing, typically more than 5’, without a sound attenuating device, there is an opportunity for exhaust pulse wave to resonate, creating drone at specific RPM intervals. Typically, OEMs do a good job of spacing stock resonators in the right location. Hope this information helps. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email!

Usually we suggest having no more that 5 ft of exhuast without a supression device in between, and the shorter the better. With that in mind, the most logical place to place the resonator would be right in the middle of your exhaust length. However, we also suggest making like for like replacements on vehicles (aftermarket resonator places where the stock resonator was and aftermarket muffler where the stock muffler was). This is because the car manufacturers usually take the time to figure out the exact ideal placement of the resonators so it’s best to match that. And this should be near the middle of the exhaust length as well, so please follow the original resonator placement.

I also tested plugging one of the two tips and the whistle went away then as well.  I believe it's the design of the 2.5\" single pipe through the muffler splitting at the end of the muffler body just creates the whistle at certain flow levels.Video: https://youtube.com/shorts/4ml8HHQgbOwI'm wondering if I possibly got either a counterfeit off of Amazon, or an old design that has been changed since?  I did find others on the internet with the same issue with the 1040.  Here's a view down one of the tips:  Thank you!-Jordan Price"

Unfortunately, Amazon is not an authorized distributor for our products, nor do we sell any of our product through Amazon. It is quite possible that parts on Amazon may be counterfeit or defective. Also, we have not experienced this whistle issue from any customers before as you mentioned. Perhaps your best bet is to reach out to the seller on Amazon. If you don’t mind, where abouts are you located? We can get you in touch with one of our sales representatives to help you source parts from an authorized distributor moving forward.

        "Content": "Hi Arman,Just as a follow up, after receiving the 1040 from Summit, I very closely inspected the muffler, and it was identical both in external construction/materials and the exact shaping/seams of pipe inside.  I considered installing it, but decided against doing the extra work for the same result.  I returned it and ordered a Vibrant 1102 instead and welded on my own tips.  The exhaust sounds great now, no whistle at all.  I'm sure it's the way the 2.5\" piping at the rear end of the 1040 muffler separates into the two outlets just prior to the end of the muffler.  It's fine before a certain flow level and I'm sure lower HP cars do not experience the issue.  I do have the 1047 (3\" version of the 1040) on another car, and no problems there.  I think it's because the shape where it splits is much different coming from a larger diameter pipe through the center of the exhaust.Anyway, ended up with good results, will still be buying more vibrant mufflers, just avoiding the 1040 :D-Jordan PriceOn Wed, Aug 14, 2024 at 10:53 AM Arman Arif  wrote:HI again Jordan, I’m glad you were able to source parts on Summit already.

Our TurboFlex couplings are mainly used for post-turbo (downpipe and exhaust assemblies) applications. We have introduced an updated version of our current bellows with a telescoping solid liner; these are called the Motorsports Bellows and they might be more suitable for your application. We have a few recommendations that we tell our customers when using our bellows:1.  The bellows assemblies do not have any flex. They are directional.2.  They only move linearly to compensate for thermal growth.3.  They should not be installed on a bend to prevent deformation or misalignment.Please see the following link to our Flexible Exhaust Coupler Guide: https://bit.ly/VibrantFlexGuideAlso, wrapping the exhaust near or on either side of the bellows can shorten its life. The problem is that all the heat will take the path of least resistance to shed from the tubing.  The wrap will not allow that to happen and so all the heat will try to escape through the bellows.

It looks like your Motorsports Bellows are the perfect thing for my application. With that being said, do you think the TurboFlex couplings have a chance of surviving? The car is my daily driver and will only be running a few pounds of boost (6-8psi). It'll certainly never see any track days, probably just the occasional street pull. I'd assume the dyno tuning session will be the most abuse the car will see. Also, the heat wrap was used for just a small portion of the up-pipe where it gets close to the starter.Let me know your thoughts. If you don't think the TurboFlex couplings will survive I'll be happy to swap them out for the Motorsports Bellows.

What worries me is that there might be a very small chance for things to go wrong if it used on a pre-turbo application.  For instance, if the interlock liners inside the TurboFlex were to fail, it will send pieces of metal up to the turbo, causing serious damage and ruining the component. That is why, we always recommend a solid internal liner like our Motor Sports Bellows. I’ve personally never seen a failure like that happen with our products, but I like to be on the more cautious side and prevent it from happening.

Coming to the topic of your muffler, the 1034 you mentioned is a 2.5” streetpower style with tips. The 3” of that style is 1045. Please see page 124 of the attached link below. This is definitely on the quieter end of the products we offer. Please check the sizing in the catalogue or speak with your fabricator for fitment. While it is difficult to tell from the picture, I believe the 1119 (3” size, page 125) is a more like for like replacement in terms of size. However, since our mufflers have a straight through perforated core, I believe you will get a more rich and deep tone. Otherwise you could try 1142 (3”, page 126) which will definitely be the most aggressive sounding and loudest. 1119 and 1142 do not come with tips so you would need to get those seperately (page 128-129). https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/78ip8w6d0nuxwayoyjnx6/2022-Vibrant-Performance-Catalogue-Web-Version.pdf?rlkey=6dxuf7ee3iai6yniudikvnnwu&e=2&utm_campaign=Download+Digital+25th&utm_medium=Social+Media&utm_source=Linkin.Bio&dl=0 Hope that information helps and please feel free to reach back with any further questions.

In theory, it should be able to double your wastegate spring pressure however, I haven’t come across end users trying to adjust the boost by 3.5bar (50psi) using Vibrant boost controllers. As such we do not have data up to that point.   Generally, a controller like this can approximately double your wastegate spring pressure. It works by bleeding off some pressure to your wastegate reference line.  For instance, lets say your wastegate has a 10psi spring, when your turbo makes 10psi, the reference line will cause the gate to open at 10psi.  With the boost controller spliced into this line, it will actually bleed off some of the pressure from the turbo to the wastegate – so if the boost controller bleeds off lets say 2 psi, than the turbo will have to make 12 psi to open the 10psi gate. Our boost controller works by bleeding off some air to your wastegate reference line, essentially tricking the wastegate to increase boost pressure.  If you look through the top hole, you will that as you turn the knob in the “+“ direction there is a needle that moves up and will open the hole up more – increasing the amount of air bled off, which increases the boost.

        "Content": "Hi Edward, Thanks for reaching out and for your interest in Vibrant products. We have a wide range of offerings in terms of mufflers and resonators. You as the customer can decide what your preference is based on sound suppresion, asthetics, and other factors. Below is a link to our catalogue: (mufflers and resonators start on page 122, appendix at the end contains sound suppression guide) https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/78ip8w6d0nuxwayoyjnx6/2022-Vibrant-Performance-Catalogue-Web-Version.pdf?rlkey=6dxuf7ee3iai6yniudikvnnwu&e=2&utm_campaign=Download+Digital+25th&utm_medium=Social+Media&utm_source=Linkin.Bio&dl=0  Please review our resonator/muffler FAQ response for additional insight that will help with your decision:I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it?Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   •         Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify.•         Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring.•         Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system. All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust and maximize horsepower. They are not flow directional.Inlet/outlets are sized by the inside diameter.  This means the exhaust tubing will slip inside the resonator/muffler neck and a lap joint weld will be made on each end to install it. Hope that information helps and please feel free to reach back with any further questions.

        "Content": "Hi Matt, Thank you for reaching out and your interest in Vibrant Performance products. It is not unheard of to put 2 of our Ultra Quiet Resonators in series before a muffler depending on the application. All of our resonators have straight through cores, so there should not be any back pressure, resulting in very minimal flow restriction. Below is a link to our catalogue: (Resonators are on page 126) https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/78ip8w6d0nuxwayoyjnx6/2022-Vibrant-Performance-Catalogue-Web-Version.pdf?rlkey=6dxuf7ee3iai6yniudikvnnwu&e=2&utm_campaign=Download+Digital+25th&utm_medium=Social+Media&utm_source=Linkin.Bio&dl=0  Please review our resonator/muffler FAQ response for additional insight that will help with your decision:I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it?Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   •         Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify.•         Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring.•         Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system. All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust.   They are not flow directional.Inlet/outlets are sized by the inside diameter.  This means the exhaust tubing will slip inside the resonator/muffler neck and a lap joint weld will be made on each end to install it.  Hope this information helps.

        "Content": "Hi Douglas, Thank you for reaching out and your interest in Vibrant Performance products. Yes, it would drop the decibels levels. All of our mufflers are universal, as a result the drops in decibel levels are application specific and would vary according to the vehicle it is on. We recommend for lowering the sound levels that you go with large body a muffler. If you want even more sound suppression, you can go with our oval body mufflers, they have more packing than our round body mufflers. Below is a link to our catalogue: (Mufflers are on page 122-126) https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/78ip8w6d0nuxwayoyjnx6/2022-Vibrant-Performance-Catalogue-Web-Version.pdf?rlkey=6dxuf7ee3iai6yniudikvnnwu&e=2&utm_campaign=Download+Digital+25th&utm_medium=Social+Media&utm_source=Linkin.Bio&dl=0  Please review our resonator/muffler FAQ response for additional insight that will help with your decision:I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it?Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   •         Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify.•         Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring.•         Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system. All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust.   They are not flow directional.Inlet/outlets are sized by the inside diameter.  This means the exhaust tubing will slip inside the resonator/muffler neck and a lap joint weld will be made on each end to install it.  Hope this information helps.

        "Content": "Hi Dominic, Thank you for your interest in Vibrant products. To answer your two main questions, the ultra quiets are quieter than the bottle styles as they have more packing material and our universal muffler would almost surely be louder than any stock muffler your car comes with. Unfortunately, we do not provide dB ratings for any of our product as that depends on many variables such as engine, NA vs turbo, placement of mufflers etc. Based on customer feedback, we are currently working on a sound library for our products, however it will be a while till that’s completed. Personally, I think the best course of action would be to look online for videos/forum posts of anyone with similar setups who have shared a dB rating. Additionally speaking to fabrication shops who work on many different vehicles could give you a good gauge of what to expect. Hope this information helps. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to reach back by call or email. Please reference our resonator/muffler FAQ response for additional info:I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it?Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   •         Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify. •         Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring. •         Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system.

Unfortunately to my sensitive ear it has a very very slight drone 1500 to 2000 rpm on light load. I dont want to go back to stock as it was too quiet and my shop suggested that we can try fitting a resonator to the straight section of the pipe, 16in long. They said that Vibrant Ultra Quiet (1144) is the best but it most likely will not not fit due to 3.5in pipe size and very limited space over stiffening plate. I was thinking bottle style resonator as a second, more compact choice (17970) but they have concerns about the fit as well as the straight section is only 16in long and this resonator length is 18in. They suggested 9in Race Muffler instead (1796) but I am not exactly sure if it will work for that drone or not.1) Can you please clarify what would be the difference between 17970 and 1796 and do you think that 1796 will do anything for me? I will retain stock back section. I am a bit concerned that race mufflers are mostly to comply with track performance rather than actual sound reduction2) Do you think I have a chance of fitting 17970 in place of this straight section (photo attached).

When it comes to our mufflers and resonators the general rule is that the more volume it has, the more packing material is within it and therefore the quieter it will be. So because of that our transverse muffler will be quieter than the ultra quiet. As for the routing options, personally the first sketch you have looks like the more optimal setup. I would suggest that the closed mode should flow exhaust through both the muffler and resonators for a quiet ride, and in the open mode the transverse muffler should have enough packing to keep it from getting obnoxiously loud.

I currently have a -10 an hose coming from the top of each valve cover ( twin turbo V6), which is then connected to the catch can. A -10 AN hose then leads to each turbo inlet pipe after the air filter ( each side is close to symmetrical/closed loop vent system). When the engine is warmed up and idling, oil vapor smoke is visible coming out on the driver side air filter, which then can be seen outside the vehicle. I put stainless steel mesh material (similar to what is used for scrubbing) inside the catch can in the hopes of it trapping oil vapor to reduce the smoke and there was no improvement.What can I do to stop the oil vapor from coming out of the air filter?Thanks, JoshSent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone"

        "Content": "Hi Trevor Thank you for reaching out and your interest in Vibrant Performance products. A resonator will definitely help, especially the ultra quiet.  It is an excellent option for reducing noise and eliminating drone plus they produce a nice deep throaty tone. The bottle style is great choice as well, however due to its size, the Ultra Quiet will be more effective in reducing sound.  The general rule of thumb when it comes to our mufflers and resonators is that: larger the body, more the packing material, as a result, the more sound suppression you will have. Plus the oval body design of the Ultra Quiet can target a wider range of drone frequencies. Please review our resonator/muffler FAQ response for additional insight that will help with your decision:I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it?Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.  The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   •         Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify.•         Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring.•         Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system. All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust.   They are not flow directional. Inlet/outlets are sized by the inside diameter.  This means the exhaust tubing will slip inside the resonator/muffler neck and a lap joint weld will be made on each end to install it. Hope this information helps. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email!

As a rotary owner myself, I am using one of our Turboflex couplings in my turbo downpipe – mind you my car is not driving yet so I am not 100% certain that it will completely withstand the heat.  In the past I have personally seen my vehicle peak at about 1500°F, and I am hoping that short bursts of this elevated temperature does impact the flex joint.  Unfortunately rotary engines can often exceed the temperature limits of many exhaust products.  The Turboflex coupling has a maximum operating temperature of 1200°F, which meets your requirement, but exceeding this for extended periods may negatively impact the cycle life of the product.  We do offer 321SS Electropolished Bellows that have a maximum operating temperature 1650°F, however this bellows do not provide any “flex”, they move linearly to compensate for thermal growth, so I would not recommend it if you need any flexability in your exhaust.One last recommendation is to consider placing the flex a little further back in your exhaust, as exhaust gas temperature can dramatically reduce as you move down the flow path of the exhaust.  This may help prolong the life of the flex.Hope this information helps.  If you have any other questions please do not hesitate to ask!

        "Content": "Hello,I am looking for some advice please on some fittings for my vehicle. I plan to mount an oil pressure gauge inline with my oil pressure sender, but am not certain what metal I should be using for the necessary fittings. Some background:My vehicle runs fully synthetic engine oil only. The vehicle is driven on the road daily, not as a track vehicle. The engine block is cast iron. I plan to thread the fitting in question into the oil filter housing, which bolts directly to the engine block. I am not certain what material the filter housing is made of, but it appears to be a cast metal as well. Maybe a cast iron or steel?The maximum oil pressure I should ever be seeing through the fitting is 120psi. The pressure sender I plan to mount on the fitting will be remote-mounted elsewhere at the end of a Vibrant Performance braided steel-lined PTFE hose after what I believe is a steel pipe adapter, so there shouldn't be an enormous bending load on the fitting itself.My question is the following: I have been told that a brass fitting would be best for this application and that I should avoid steel fittings by one shop (since steel responds to the heat of the oil quickly), that steel will be the best metal for the application by another shop, and have seen all kinds of conflicting advice online about what metal would be best. It seems to me that brass would be ok, but I cannot afford to risk damaging my engine by using the wrong material and either breaking the fitting, or causing other engine damage. Can you please recommend the best metal for the fitting I need?Thanks,Colin "

I think steel would probably be too hard on that basis, so brass might be my best bet? Thinking in terms of compatibility with oil, etc, as well as compatibility between metals. I know the brass is harder than the aluminium, but the one material I haven't yet had recommended to me is aluminium 😅.Am I correct in thinking that I should be wrapping the threads in Teflon tape to seal the joint?Thanks,ColinOn Mon, 10 Jun 2024, 1:45 pm Kyle Hyatali,  wrote:Hi Colin,  Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in Vibrant Performance products!

Chemical compatibility isn’t a concern for anodized aluminum parts, only raw aluminum with alcohols I believe. Teflon tape is really only necessary for NPT threads that seal using thread interference.  Typical straight thread seal using either a crush washer, o-ring, or face to face metal seal (AN fittings with 37° flare).Hope this information helps.

        "Content": "Hi Dustin, Thank you for reaching out and your interest in Vibrant Performance products. I do not have a specific sound reduction efficiency value on hand, however I can let you know the general rule of thumb for our mufflers and resonators – The large the body size, the more sound suppresion you will have, as a result, the quieter your vheicle will be.  Please see our below Muffler/Resonator FAQ’s.  Every application would be different, therefore I normally recommend a consultation through your local exhaust shop as they can physically see the vehicle and help advise you more directly to what will work best for your needs. Please review our resonator/muffler FAQ response for additional insight that will help with your decision as well as the attached selection guide from our catalogue: I want to purchase a Vibrant Performance resonator or muffler, what do I need to know before I install it? Several factors will determine exhaust note and how a particular resonator or muffler will impact the result.  Building a complete system using Vibrant products will produce different results based on engine size, number of cylinders, firing order, valve timing, etc.  A V8 engine with cast stock exhaust manifolds will get different exhaust wave frequencies than a 4-cylinder boxer engine with an equal length header.  In most street applications, our products have excellent resonance wave absorption properties due to the dense ceramic/fiberglass composite packing we use which will provide a quiet, subtle, but awake exhaust note at low engine speeds.  When you put your right foot down, you will bring the engine to life and things will get rowdy.   The construction of Vibrant resonators and mufflers is fundamentally the same. They all have a perforated core tube that runs through the body that is wrapped with a stainless-steel mesh.  The remainder of the body is densely packed with a ceramic/fiberglass composite packing material.  The name “Resonator” is the industry name for the suppressive device that is in the mid-pipe area of an exhaust system as this is the most common area to see a significant resonance frequency in the exhaust stream.  The name “Muffler” is what the larger suppressive device is called as it does the most muffling of the exhaust note out the back of the vehicle.   There are 3 key points to keep in mind when choosing and installing a resonator and/or muffler.   *   Size.  The general rule of thumb with Vibrant resonators/mufflers is that the larger the body of the device, the more effective it will be at reducing decibel levels, drone, rasp, etc.  Larger volume of packing = more harmonic wave absorption.  Aside from the volume of packing material making it more effective, is the shape.  This is also part of the reason that the Ultra Quiet is a popular choice over bottle style resonators or round body mufflers.  Each time your exhaust valve opens, an exhaust pulse wave travels down your exhaust stream.  It bounces in all directions as it moves through the exhaust system.  The frequency can be affected by the shape, size and length of chambers, tubing, etc.  When the pulse wave meets a suppressive device with packing material, it is dampened as it travels through the perforated core, into the packing material, reflects off the outside wall and back through the packing material to rejoin the exhaust system.  In a round suppressive device, the distance for the pulse wave to travel from core to outer body is uniform, compared to the Ultra Quiet resonator which has an oval shape with variable distances for the pulse wave to travel through.  This makes it more effective at attenuating a broad spectrum of frequencies of the exhaust note.  The same principle applies to a chambered suppressive device but placement becomes very important because the lack of packing material removes the ability to dampen vibration as the pulse wave travels through the chambers.  They rely only on pulse wave reflection to cancel out frequencies.  Also, keep in mind that a larger diameter tube can lead to an increase in drone/resonance since there is a larger underdamped surface area that can cause the sound waves to amplify. *   Placement.  This also plays a key role in regards to reducing exhaust drone.  For most applications we recommend placement of a resonator in the area under the front seats of the vehicle.  Targeting this placement will be effective for drone frequencies that are exhibited at low to mid-range steady state throttle/engine load conditions (ie: highway driving).  In many applications the room available for a resonator in this area is limited, so smaller body “bottle style” resonators are often employed.  Installing a resonator in this area will help prevent that drone frequency from reverberating through the floor and into the passenger cabin.  Keeping the resonator further upstream also benefits in cancelling out that drone frequency earlier in the system, preventing it from travelling the full length of your exhaust.  Placement will be dependent upon available space as well and is often the most limiting factor for installation.  Placement further downstream in the exhaust path will target higher RPM frequencies and overall decibel reduction.  This is typical placement for most larger body mufflers.  Use your best judgement in identifying where any drone is occurring, in some cases, resonance frequencies can be at their peak further downstream just ahead of the rear axle of the vehicle, this will be a drone emitting from the rear seat area. Target placement in the area where you identify any unwanted frequency is occurring. *   Spacing.  When you have a long length of exhaust tubing (more than 5’) without a suppression device, there is an opportunity for exhaust valve pulse wave resonance frequencies to be amplified- much the same way if you were to strike 2 tuning forks that are different lengths- the longer fork will have a larger amplitude. Your exhaust tubing behaves the same way with the pulse wave sent down from the exhaust valve smashing open and closed at incredible speeds- the longer the length without a suppressive device, the more opportunity for a drone frequency to be amplified.  For this reason, it is also ideal to try to prevent placement of resonators and or mufflers too close together so they remain most effective across the length of the system. All Vibrant resonators and mufflers feature a straight through perforated stainless core design to minimize flow disruption of the exhaust.   They are not flow directional.Inlet/outlets are sized by the inside diameter.  This means the exhaust tubing will slip inside the resonator/muffler neck and a lap joint weld will be made on each end to install it.  Hope this information helps.

For hard metals like steel, it may also be necessary to slightly scuff the area that the compression fitting mate to, to ensure the ferrule bites into the material. *   Make sure the compression fitting is appropriately sized for your hardline.  The compression ferrule should move freely over the hardline, but with little to no play between the compression ferrule and hardline.  Our Tube Adapter fittings are sized for the hardline Tube OD.*   Make sure your hardline is round where the ferrule is compressed.*   Tighten the fitting until you have approximately 1mm gap between the S-Nut and the adapter body.

Unfortunately, if the part you have is not a genuine Vibrant product, we can’t ensure a leak-proof seal even if the dimensions are identical. Hope that helps and feel free to reach out if you have any more questions.  Arman ArifTechnical Support Vibrant Performance310 Courtneypark Drive East Mississauga, ON L5T 2S5T: 905-564-2808 x271    "
